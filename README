For usage see mongodb.php

This is very alpha code!

What I plan to do in the future is try and convert this file into more of an active record style library so you can write:

// Update everyone who is 20 in the USA to have a legal drinking status
$this->mongodb->connect('localhost', 27017)->db('dbname')->collection('people');
$this->mongodb->where_gte('age' => 21)->where('country' => 'USA')->set('can_drink' => TRUE);
